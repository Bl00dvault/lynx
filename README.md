# Lynx
I have a ton of links saved and a million tabs open. To prep for migrating to Obsidian, I need to organize the several different open source solutions I've been using and just concatenate all the links in one place. 

## TODO
- [x] All open Chrome Tabs
- [ ] LinkAce
- [x] Bookmarks
- [ ] Create tagging schema
- [ ] Tag all unlabeled links
- [ ] Create folder structure
- [ ] Create a script to automate the process of adding links to Obsidian
